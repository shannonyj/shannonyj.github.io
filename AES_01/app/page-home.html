      The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is formal encryption method adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of<br>
      the US Government, and is accepted worldwide. It is founded on solid and well-published mathematical ground, and appears to resist <br>
      all known attacks with no back-door or known weakness.

          <h3>AES Background</h3>
          <p>
            In 1997 the US National Institute of Standards and Technology put out a call for candidates for a
            replacement for the ageing Data Encryption Standard, DES. 15 candidates were accepted for further
            consideration, and after a fully public process and three open international conferences, the final
            candidate was announced and comments were solicited. It was developed by Belgian
            researchers in Belgium therefore voiding the conspiracy theories sometimes voiced concerning an
            encryption standard developed by a United States government agency.

          <h3>AES Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            The AES encryption algorithm is a block cipher that uses
            an encryption key and several rounds of encryption. A
            block cipher is an encryption algorithm that works on a
            single block of data at a time. In the case of standard AES
            encryption the block is 128 bits, or 16 bytes, in length. The
            term “rounds” refers to the way in which the encryption
            algorithm mixes the data re-encrypting it ten to fourteen
            times depending on the length of the key.
            The AES algorithm itself is not a computer program or
            computer source code. It is a mathematical description
            of a process of obscuring data.

          <h3>Encryption Keys</h3>
          <p>
            AES encryption uses a single key as a part of the
            encryption process. The key can be 128 bits (16 bytes),
            192 bits (24 bytes), or 256 bits (32 bytes) in length.
          </p>
          <p>
            With AES both the encryption and the
            decryption are performed using the same key. This is
            called a symmetric encryption algorithm. An encryption key
            is simply a binary string of data used
            in the encryption process. Because the same encryption
            key is used to encrypt and decrypt data, it is important
            to keep the encryption key a secret and to use keys that
            are hard to guess. Some keys are generated by software
            used for this specific task. Another method is to derive a
            key from a pass phrase. Good encryption systems never
            use a pass phrase alone as an encryption key.
